## Hi there, I'm Isly 👋

🎓 Finishing up my time at **Codam**, where I've spent the last years learning by building — from low-level systems to full web applications.

🚀 I'm currently working on **Transcendence**, the final project of the 42 curriculum, which blends full-stack web development, real-time features, and lots of learning along the way.

💡 I'm passionate about understanding how things work under the hood — especially when it comes to networking, asynchronous programming, and scalable architecture.

> 🧠 If it looks like I haven’t pushed much here — it’s because I’ve spent most of my time working in **Vogsphere**, Codam’s internal version control system (Git-based but private). So while GitHub's been a bit quiet, the code definitely hasn’t.

> ❤️ Fun fact: I always name things after my girlfriend. If you see a project with the name **Marie** or similar, it's my way of showing some love and inspiration from her. 😊
