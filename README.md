## Hi there, I'm Isly 👋

🎓 Wrapping up my journey at **Codam**, where I’ve been diving deep into the world of low-level programming, networks, and system architecture.

💡 I enjoy solving problems from the ground up — understanding how things work under the hood, building efficient solutions, and learning by doing.

🛠️ Most of my work is in **C++**, **C**, and **shell**, with an increasing curiosity for tools that scale and automate.

### 🌱 What I'm into right now

- Systems programming & architecture
- Clean, maintainable code
- Asynchronous I/O & networking
- Exploring new tools, workflows, and weird bugs 😅
